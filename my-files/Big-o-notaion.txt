Big O Notaion :
    is a way to measure the time complexity in any algorithm 

o(1) : constant time 
    - like access array using indexes
    - delete element that we  know it's index 
    - access keys in hash tables


o(n) : linear time 
      - the time will increase with the size of the input
      - like access all array elements to search for something using a loop
