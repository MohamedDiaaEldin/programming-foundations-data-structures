*** this information could be diffrent from language to another

Signed data types :
    contains positive and negative values 
Unsigned data types :
    contains only positive values and doubles the positive values range 

    example:  if we have signed short with range -32768 to 32767
              the unsigned range of short  will be from 0 to 65535 



primitive data types :
    - is the basic building block of any piece of data  
    - we can build more data complex data structuer using primitive data types 




Whole number :
    short   --->  -32768 to 32767             ----> 16 bits 
    int     --->  -2billion  to 2 billions    ----> 32 bits 
    long    --->  -2^63  to 2^63              ----> 64 bits 

Decimal Numbers :
    float   ---->  7 decimal digits           ----> 32 bits
    double  ---->  16 decimal digits          ----> 64 bits

Booleans:
    True  --> 1 --> on
    False --> 0 --> Off

String :
    is a data type describes a sequence of characters  
    in other words it's array of characters
