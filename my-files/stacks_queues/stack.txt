stack : - is a double linked list (we can represent it with array)
        - add at the top queue 
        - remove from begening of queue  
                (first in , first out (FIFO)) 
        
        - it's useful while keeping track of state or the order of when things that have accrued
        - it's useful while reverse a string



adding item to the queue is called      : Enqueue    o(1)
removeing item from the queue is called : Dequeue    o(1)
