queue : - is a double linked list (we can represent it with array)
        - add and remove always from the top (Last in , First out (LIFO) )
        - it's useful while keeping track of state or the order of when things that have accrued

        
adding item to the stack is called      : Push   o(1)
removeing item from the stack is called : Pop    o(1)


Priority queue

    - each element has a priority associated with it 
       so the first element will Dequeue is the element with highest priority

    - defining a priority needs an implementation to comparator and compare method
    
    - example : giving a priority to queue element to pop the smallest number 
              it's helpul while implementing some of graph algorithms 


Dequek :
    - it's a stack and queue in the same time 
    - we can choice either stack or queue operation that we want 
    - we can not remove from any where else from the collection
