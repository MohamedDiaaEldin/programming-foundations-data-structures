linked list is a group of nodes which is connected to each other using pointers 

general notes :
  add last or first is            o(1)
  remove last or first is         o(1)
  
  add at index is                 o(n)
  remove at index is              o(n)
  
  get element by index is         o(n)
  search or access element is     o(n)



single linked list : it contains a head (first node)reference in single linked list
     each node contains only next reference  
        add first is         o(1) 
        add last is          o(n)
        add in the middle is o(n)

doubly linked list : it contains a head AND tail (last node) reference in doubly linked list
      each node contains a next and pervious references
        add first is         o(1) 
        add last is          o(1) 
        add in the middle is o(n)
