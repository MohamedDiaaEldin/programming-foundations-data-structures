array : - is a collection of data 
        - every piece of data can be access using indexes    
            example : 
                     index 0    index 1  index 2
                        ^        ^          ^
                        |        |          |     
                    ["Mohamed", "Ali", "Hossam"]
        
        - if we tried to access index that is not included in the array the
             programe with throw an exception "out of range" in run time


example using  swift : using array that store integers and calculate the
                       sum and the averages of students grades 

var grades  = [10, 15, 5]
var sum = 0

for grade in grades {
    sum += grade
}
print("sum is :", sum)

var average = sum / grades.count
print("average is :", average)
