Example in java :  to search for a name in String array 

        String[] studentNames = new String[]{"mohamed", "Ali", "Hossam"} ;
        String nameToSearch = "Ali" ;
        for (int i=0 ; i<studentNames.length ; i++){
              if(studentNames[i].equals(nameToSearch)){
                   System.out.println("Found: "+ studentNames[i]);
                   break ;
              }
        }


this kind of search is called linear search 
this kind of search is slow especially while the size of the array is bigger
and the time will increase with the size of array
    the idea is to loop over every element in the array
    and check if the current element equals to the name that i want to search 

sorting an array will give us change to search for much shorter time

the best case to find the wanted element ---> when the element in index 0
the worst case to find the wanted element ---> when the element in index ( array size - 1 )
